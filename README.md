turtle graphics in javascript
=============================

established November 2010


Turtle graphics are a powerful tool for using computers to teach some
sophisticated concepts in an age appropriate way to even young
children.  

For example, in the summer of 2008 I used LOGO to teach an advanced
fifth-grader about fractals, recursion, functional programming, and
removing repetition in an extremely small number of lines of code and
in only a few hours at the computer.  I wrote about that experience in
detail here:

[Logo, Fractals, and Recursion; Programming, and Removing Repetition](http://dobbse.net/thinair/2008/12/logo-fractals-recursion.html)

My main motivation for developing this library is to enable others to
repeat those exercises in a web browser, especially on a mobile phone
or tablet computer.  

As of September 2011 I've got most of the tools I was hoping to build
including a kind of command history and versioning, an interactive
shell and some animation.  See the live demo at http://dobbs.github.com.
